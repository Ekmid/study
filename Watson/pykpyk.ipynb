First, in 1995, cities represented the major percentage of habitat by roughly 50 percent, followed by rural areas and towns came in last, among people born in Australia. On the other hand, people born outside Australia, cities showed the most percentages of 6o percent, followed by rural areas and towns. In 2010, among people born in Australia, cities had an increase more than 20 percent increase in the total representation and a major decrease in towns and rural areas.
